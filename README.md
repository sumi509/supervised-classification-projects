# Loan Repayment Prediction

## Overview
This project demonstrates a supervised classification approach to predict whether a loan will be repaid based on customer data. The notebook uses machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models to identify repayment patterns and optimize financial decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Standardizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing key trends and patterns in the data.
  - Identifying correlations between features and loan repayment status.
- **Model Training**:
  - Logistic Regression.
  - Random Forest Classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
  - Confusion matrix and feature importance analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Data distribution plots.
  - Performance metric charts for model evaluation.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loan_Repayment_Precidtion.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the notebook sections to:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis.
   - Train and evaluate the models.
3. Experiment with different hyperparameters or models to improve predictions.
